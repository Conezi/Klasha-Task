- Given that an ingredient is past its `use-by` date (inclusive), I should not be able to choose that ingredient.

I commented out the block of code that handles the above requirement because all the ingredient currently returned by the endpoint comes with outdated `use-by` date. You can find the said lines of code in the IngredientsScreen class
